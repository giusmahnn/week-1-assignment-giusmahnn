# Week 1: Introduction & Foundational Skills (Focus on Project Relevance)

This week, we'll be diving into the exciting world of SQL and databases! We'll explore what SQL is used for, how it benefits web applications, and the building blocks of databases: tables, columns, and data types. But most importantly, we'll get our hands dirty by creating a basic database structure for our upcoming Expense Tracker project!

## Learning Objectives:
Understand the purpose and applications of SQL, particularly for web applications.
Identify the fundamental components of a database: tables, columns, and data types.
Design a basic database schema for our Expense Tracker project.
Instructions
This assignment is designed to be completed in approximately 2 hours.

**What you'll need:**

Access to a computer with internet access
A text editor (Microsoft Word document)
Drawing software (e.g. Draw.io, visual paradigm) for the bonus question.

## Part 1: Understanding SQL (30 minutes)

**Question 1. Research**

Use online resources like websites or PowerPoint slides.
**1.1.** In a single Word document, summarize your findings in a short paragraph (3-5 sentences).
Web Applications:  

Imagine a dynamic website like an online store. How do you think SQL plays a role in managing data behind the scenes? Consider how product information, user accounts, and order details might be stored and accessed.

**1.2.** Write a short explanation (3-5 sentences) in your document about the role of SQL in web applications.

**1.3.** List 3 benefits of using SQL for web applications.

**1.4.** Think about efficiency, data organization, and data retrieval capabilities. Briefly explain each benefit in your document (1-2 sentences per benefit).

**1.5.** List any 3 Database Management Systems. 

## Part 2: Database Fundamentals (45 minutes)

**Question 2.1: Tables**

Think about how data is organized in rows and columns.
In your document, define a database table and explain its similarity to a spreadsheet (2-3 sentences).

**Question 2.2: Columns**

Consider different types of data like text, numbers, and dates.
Define "columns" and provide an example with an explanation (2-3 sentences) in your document.
Data Types: Why are data types important in a database? Briefly explain 3 common data types (e.g., Text, Number, Date).

**Question 2.3: Data Types**

Think about how data types ensure data integrity and efficient storage.
Explain the importance of data types and provide brief explanations of 3 common types (2-3 sentences each) in your document.

## Part 3: Expense Tracker Database Design (45 minutes)

**3.1. Planning:** 
We'll be building an Expense Tracker application. What kind of data do you think we'll need to track? List at least 5 data points relevant to our project.

* Consider information like expense amount, date, and category.
* List your identified data points in your document.

**3.2. Tables:** 
Considering the data points you listed, design a basic database schema with one main table (likely named "Expenses").

* Define the columns needed for this table.
* Assign appropriate data types to each column based on the kind of data it will hold. (e.g., amount: number, date: date, category: text)
  
  In your document, create a table structure that includes:
* Table name (e.g., Expenses)
* Column names (e.g., expense_id, amount, date, category)
* Data type for each column (e.g., INT, DECIMAL, DATE, TEXT)

## Bonus:  

Sketch a simple Entity Relational Diagram (ERD) of your table structure, including column names and data types.

Use drawing software or a simple table format to visually represent your schema.

** Remember: There might be multiple ways to design your database schema. The goal is to understand the concepts and create a logical structure to store our expense tracking data.
